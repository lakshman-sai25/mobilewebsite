# responsive-website-mediaqueries

This project demonstrates how to make a visually appealing website responsive and mobile-friendly using CSS media queries.
 ðŸ”§ Key Features Implemented:
   1.Responsive Layout: Adjusted positioning and size of elements like navigation bar, content, and buttons based on screen width.
   2.Media Query Usage: A @media screen and (max-width: 600px) query was used to target devices with smaller screens (like mobile phones).
   3.Fixed Social Icons in Mobile View:
    --Moved the social icons from the right sidebar to the bottom center.
    --Used position: fixed, left: 50%, and transform: translateX(-50%) to center the icons.
    --Maintained spacing between icons using gap.
    --Ensured icons didnâ€™t stretch or distort by setting fixed width/height and using object-fit: contain.

    By using media queries, we improved the mobile usability and layout of the webpage, ensuring consistent appearance and interaction across various device sizes.
